  <h1>My Favorite Superheroes: A Semantic Webpage</h1>
  <h2>DC heroes</h2>
  <p><em>DC superhero comics are the best.</em><br> the storylines are more complex, and <u>often address real life social issues.</u> My favorite is <strong>Green Arrow.</strong></p>
  <h3><small>Marvel heroes or whatever</small></h3>
  <p><q>Marvel superhero comics feel more 2-dimensional.</q> However, Marvel is really killing it in the film and TV industried, wheras DC attempts to capitalize on the TV and film industries are more mediocre. </p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

<p>To summarize, Marvel comics are not as cool as DC heroes,</p> <blockquote>but they do have decent movies and TV shows for whatever that's worth</blockquote>
